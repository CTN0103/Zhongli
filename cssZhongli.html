				<h2>Personality</h2>
				<p>Zhongli is a calm, reserved, and polite man, who holds an air of nostalgia. He knows much about Liyue's history and culture in part due to his time as the Geo Archon; like Venti, he has many experiences and memories, as he was a god well before The Seven even existed. He holds philosophical ideas towards money and has great respect for Liyue's traditions, including those that have been forgotten or warped over time. Zhongli tends to be humble, being worried he comes off as a "bourgeois parasite".<br><br>

Zhongli tends to forget about Mora in transactions, agreeing to spend large sums of it without having any Mora on hand and even taking "discounts" as granted despite being an obvious scam.[3] He often ends up relying on his acquaintances for financial support, such as the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor or Childe. Although he works for Hu Tao, he does not like her childish behavior.<br><br>

It is later revealed that Zhongli's "carelessness" stems from being the creator of Mora. With the Gnosis allowing him to create limitless Mora, he never had to worry about running low on his personal finances. Unfortunately, when he chose to live among mortals, he lacked the foresight to find an alternative for them to continue minting Mora in his absence, along with creating a retirement fund for himself. As a result, he shamelessly spends the Mora of others.<br>

				<h1>MORAX</h1>
				<p>Morax or Rex Lapis is the God of Contracts, Commerce, and the Warrior God — among many other names. He was the Geo Archon and is the oldest of "The Seven," and possibly being one of the oldest, if not the oldest, gods at over six thousand years old.<br><br>

                In addition to forming the geography of the region he governs, Rex Lapis defended Liyue in great battles such as the Archon War, which was waged in the area that is now Guili Plains against other gods. In one battle, he successfully defeated an ancient god known as Osial, using massive stone lances to imprison the sea god, which is now known as the Guyun Stone Forest. In another, he sealed the Mountain Dragon Azhdaha under a tree in Nantianmen following the dragon's rebellion. Other gods Rex has slain include the Chi of Yore, and Xiao's former master, the God of Dreams.<br><br>

                Morax is also the source and namesake of Teyvat's currency, the Mora. Mora is minted at the Golden House through the use of Morax's Gnosis.<br><br>

                Currently, Rex Lapis resides in Liyue Harbor as Zhongli, working at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor as a consultant.</p>

		<p>Zhongli (Chinese: 钟离 Zhōnglí) is a playable Geo character in Genshin Impact.<br><br>
        He first appears in the Archon Quests Chapter I: Act II - Farewell, the Archaic Lord. He is later revealed to be the current vessel of the Geo Archon, Morax, who has decided to experience the world from the perspective of a mortal. After giving up his Gnosis, he retires from his position as an Archon and returns to his former identity as an Adeptus, although still under the guise of being a human. He currently works as a consultant of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.</p><br>

		<h1>Trivia</h1>
		<li>Zhongli may be one of, if not the, oldest gods in Teyvat, at over six thousand years old.</li>
		<li>In the Teyvat Travel Guide - Liyue, the author, Alice, names Zhongli as her companion during her travels to that region.</li>
	    <li>On the Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board, one anonymous message is likely Zhongli's.</li>
	    <li>Zhongli is the first character whose Story Quest Chapter name did not derive from his Constellation.</li>
	    <li>Zhongli is also the first character whose in-game Profile and Story sections change depending on Archon Quest completion; before completing Chapter 1, Act 3, his "Vision" is listed as Geo (and his Story section shows Vision, albeit locked until Act 3 is completed), while his constellation is labeled "???". After completing it, "Vision" changes to "Gnosis" on both his Profile and Story menus, while his constellation is revealed.</li>
	    <li>Zhongli is extremely knowledgeable about money, government, and Liyue's traditions and history. He even remembers customs and traditions that have been watered down, forgotten, and lost to time — as if he was there himself.</li>
	    <li>Zhongli is one of the few currently playable characters who acknowledges (or even seems to be aware) that the Traveler is from another world, presumably because of his status as an Archon.</li>
	    <li>The meteor summoned by Zhongli's Elemental Burst, Planet Befall, resembles a Burr puzzle, specifically the six-piece burr which is also known as the "Chinese Cross".</li>
